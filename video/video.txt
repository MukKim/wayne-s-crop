Hi, our group name is Wayne's Crop and we represent the IOT Agriculture Team.
Our team members are Jeong-yeon Yu, HyunMuk Kim, Jiae Yun, and Jordan Kramer.

This is the diagram illistrating our project.

Our website crawls Weatherspark and uses it to obtain and display data for regions we do not cover.
The graph updates every 60 seconds with our sensor's Temperature and Humidity data.
We can use this data to calculate correlation and regression between the temperature and humidity.
After obtaining the initial data, we will activate our irrigation system and obtian a new set of data allowing us correlate and compare results. 
With these results we can increase crop yields and decrease waster waste by irrigating only in areas that require water.
The home page displays our project as well as our graphs and data.


These are our videos. We took videos during many of our experiments.

This is our mini farm.
We used the mini farm to scale down our experiements and determine if they would be applicable to widescale implementation.
Specifically we used this for testing our irrigation systems and growing the plants.
